# Course Website

This site is deployed at: http://angding.pythonanywhere.com/

A redesign of a current [CSCB63 website](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~bretscher/b20/).

Use student test account:
  Username: `student1`
  Password: `student1`
  
Use instructor test account:

This was a project done for CSCB20 course at UTSC - Databases and Web Applications.


## Functionality includes:
* Users can sign up as a `student` or `instructor` user types
* A `student` can view their grades and submit remark requests for a certain grade
* A `student` can also submit anonymous feedback to a certain instructor
* An `instructor` can view all student grades and change a grade if requested by a remark request
* An `instructor` can view all anonymous feedback only directed to them
* All users if logged in can access all other features of the website


## What I learned:
* Using HTML and CSS to design the webpage layout and styling
* Understood more of the CSS Box Model
* Using Javascript for DOM manipulation and form validation
* Using the python microframework, Flask as a backend
* Using Flask to talk to the SQLite database and send data back to the front end
* Making a simple login page that checks for validation
* Creating sessions for users that persists over the duration they are logged in
* Creating and understanding the basics of RESTful services

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript as the frontend and Flask + SQLite as the backend.
